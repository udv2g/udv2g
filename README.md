This repository is maintained by the [Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle-to-grid) subgroup of University of Delaware's [CVORG](https://www.cvorg.ece.udel.edu/) research group in association with the [Transport Electrification Center](https://sites.udel.edu/jamcl/).  (Updated June 27, 2022)

Our aim is to provide [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) hardware and software implementations of, and tools related to, the standards (such as [SAE J3068 ](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3068_201804/) and [ISO 61851-1 Annex D](https://www.cvorg.ece.udel.edu/ev-center/iec-61851-1-annex-d/)) we are involved in.  

Some of our current projects include a [Reference implementation of SAE J3068](https://github.com/udv2g/saej3068-ref) and an [SAE J3068 communications emulator](https://github.com/udv2g/saej3068-emulator) intended to facilitate the development of extensions to SAE J3068 such as SAE J3068/1 and SAE J3068/2.
